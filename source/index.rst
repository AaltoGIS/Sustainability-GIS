Spatial Data Science for Sustainable Development 2021
=====================================================

**Spatial data science for sustainable development** course introduces various spatial data science methods
which are applied to different sustainability topics/questions.
The course covers techniques and modeling approaches for vector and raster data formats as well as for data presented using networks.

After completing this course, you should:
- understand and deepen your knowledge of a range of modern spatial data science (SDS) techniques and methodologies
- be able to apply SDS methodologies in practice to a range of sustainability/global change related topics with Python programming language
- have skills and understanding how to retrieve, handle and analyze modern big geospatial data in different formats

.. admonition:: Interactive contents

    Each lesson in this course can be turned into an interactive programming session in the browser!
    You can find buttons for activating the python environment using `Thebe <https://thebe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
    or `Binder <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ at the top of each programming lesson. Students at Finnish
    higher education institutions are encourage to use the `CSC notebooks <https://notebooks.csc.fi/>`__ environment.

Course format
-------------

The majority of this course will be spent in front of a computer writing code with the Python language.
The course consists of interactive lectures, readings and weekly exercises. The exercises will focus on
applying the introduced SDS methods to given sustainability related problem.

Most exercises in this course involve real world examples and data. For each exercise, you may be asked to
submit the Python codes you have written, output figures and answers to related questions. You are encouraged to
discuss and work together with other students while working on the weekly exercises. The final exercise must be
completed individually and must clearly reflect your own work (in short, donâ€™t copy paste from other students).

.. admonition:: Aalto University students

    The Spatial Data Science for Sustainable Development course is part of the
    `Master's Programme in Geoinformatics at Aalto University <https://www.aalto.fi/en/study-options/masters-programme-in-geoinformatics>`__
    under the course code ``GIS-E4040``.

.. admonition:: Online teaching

    Please note that the course is organized completely online during the 2021 Spring semester.
    Access to zoom, slack and CSC notebooks is available to students at Finnish higher education institutes.


Program
-------

The course runs for six weeks at the Aalto University starting in the third teaching period on Monday the 11th of January 2021.
Each week covers selected SDS methodologies which are applied to topics/problems relevant for selected sustainable development goals (SDG).
Topics per week are listed below. Please note that this web page is updated each week before the lesson:
