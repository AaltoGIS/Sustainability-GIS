**Spatial data science for sustainable development** course introduces various spatial data science methods
that are applied to selected sustainability topics/questions. The course is inspired by the United Nation's
`2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development <https://sdgs.un.org/goals>`__
as well as the `Global Sustainable Development Report <https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/24797GSDR_report_2019.pdf>`__,
and numerous scientific articles that have investigated sustainability related problems through the lense of spatial analytics.
The course aims to provide a bridge between ``sustainability`` and ``spatial data science``,
that provides various useful methodological approaches to understand, model and quantify different sustainability
related phenomena.

After completing this course, you should:

- understand and deepen your knowledge of a range of modern spatial data science (SDS) techniques and methodologies
- be able to apply SDS methodologies in practice to a range of sustainability/global change related topics with Python programming language
- have skills and understanding how to retrieve, handle and analyze modern big geospatial data in different formats.

**Prerequirements**

Before taking this course, it is required to know the basics of Python programming as well as GIS.
If you are new to Python, or would like to refresh your Python skills, we recommend to start with an online
and open access course called Geo-Python which is available at `geo-python.github.io <http://geo-python.github.io/>`__.
If you need to refresh your Python GIS skills, we recommend starting with a course Automating GIS-processes available
at `autogis.github.io <https://autogis.github.io/>`__. Both of these courses include tutorials, videos and exercises.


.. admonition:: Help improving the materials

    **This is version 1.**

    The course is given for the very first time in 2021, meaning that the content of the course is likely to change and
    improve after each time the course is given (all versions will be available). By being a fully open
    educational resource, **you can also help making the course better**.
    If you find any errors, typos, or other problems, please help, by suggesting an edit in GitHub. You can do this easily by clicking
    ``suggest edit`` under the GitHub icon located at
    the top-right on each page:

    If you have good ideas what should be taught, or what methods, interesting datasets or literature should be introduced
    during the course, you can suggest and bring your ideas forward by `raising an issue in GitHub <https://github.com/AaltoGIS/Sustainability-GIS/issues/new>`__.


Course format
-------------

The majority of this course will be spent in front of a computer writing code with the Python language.
The course consists of interactive lectures, readings and weekly exercises. The exercises will focus on
applying the introduced SDS methods to given sustainability related problem.

Most exercises in this course involve real world examples and data. For each exercise, you may be asked to
submit the Python codes you have written, output figures and answers to related questions. You are encouraged to
discuss and work together with other students while working on the weekly exercises. The final exercise must be
completed individually and must clearly reflect your own work (in short, donâ€™t copy paste from other students).

.. admonition:: Aalto University students

    The Spatial Data Science for Sustainable Development course is part of the
    `Master's Programme in Geoinformatics at Aalto University <https://www.aalto.fi/en/study-options/masters-programme-in-geoinformatics>`__
    under the course code ``GIS-E4040``.

.. admonition:: Interactive contents

    Each lesson in this course can be turned into an interactive programming session in the browser!
    You can find buttons for activating the python environment using `Thebe <https://thebe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
    or `Binder <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ at the top of each programming lesson. Students at Finnish
    higher education institutions are encourage to use the `CSC notebooks <https://notebooks.csc.fi/>`__ environment.

.. admonition:: Online teaching

    Please note that the course is organized completely online during the 2021 Spring semester.
    Access to zoom, slack and CSC notebooks is available to students at Finnish higher education institutes.


Program (tentative)
-------------------

The course runs for six weeks at the Aalto University starting in the third teaching period on Monday the 11th of January 2021.
Each week covers selected spatial data science (SDS) methodologies which are applied to topics/problems relevant for selected sustainable development goals (SDG).
Topics per week are listed below. Please note that this web page is updated each week before the lesson:
