    "This notebook covers a brief and gentle introduction to spatial econometrics in Python. To do that, we will use a set of Austin properties listed in AirBnb.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of spatial econometrics is to introduce a formal representation of space into the statistical framework for regression. This can be done in many ways: by including predictors based on space (e.g. distance to relevant features), by splitting the datasets into subsets that map into different geographical regions (e.g. [spatial regimes](http://pysal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/spreg/regimes.html)), by exploiting close distance to other observations to borrow information in the estimation (e.g. [kriging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging)), or by introducing variables that put in relation their value at a given location with those in nearby locations, to give a few examples. Some of these approaches can be implemented with standard non-spatial techniques, while others require bespoke models that can deal with the issues introduced. In this short tutorial, we will focus on the latter group. In particular, we will introduce some of the most commonly used methods in the field of spatial econometrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example we will use to demonstrate this draws on hedonic house price modelling. This a well-established methodology that was developed by [Rosen (1974)](hhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/1830899) that is capable of recovering the marginal willingness to pay for goods or services that are not traded in the market. In other words, this allows us to put an implicit price on things such as living close to a park or in a neighborhood with good quality of air. In addition, since hedonic models are based on linear regression, the technique can also be used to obtain predictions of house prices.\n",

I arrived in Austin in 1973 and spent summers swimming at Barton Springs, played shirtless in the garden of the infamous Armadillo World Headquarters, lived two blocks from the Rome Inn where Stevie Ray Vaughan played the blues weekly. \\r\\n\\r\\nI graduated from Austin High and studied viola performance at the UT School of Music in 1987 while playing jazz fusion in 6th street clubs on the weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music scene has drastically changed since I was a kid growing up at UT\\u0027s married student housing next to Tom Miller dam. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy jazz string quartet, an early incarnation of Strings Attached, was invited to play at the keynote of the 1988 SXSW music festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u0027ve lived briefly in other places, but I\\u0027m still convinced that Austin is one of the coolest places to make a life. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is my past musical background? \\r\\n\\r\\n     I play the the viola, violin, guitar, and piano, more or less in that order.  I started on the viola when I was 10; I was intrigued by its lack of popularity. I asked the orchestra teacher which instrument is the most ignored, and that was that. I took up the guitar a couple years later because my Dad had bought 6 months of lessons for my brother, who pretty much quit after the first couple lessons.  I didn\\u0027t want the remaining 5 months\\u0027 worth to go to waste.  The violin and the piano just naturally followed. \\r\\n\\r\\n    I\\u0027ve played for 21 years in the Austin Lyric Opera Pit orchestra, played with orchestras all over Texas, toured the U.S. and Canada with my own Jazz group in the 90\\u0027s, and the Turtle Island ( jazz) String Quartet.  \\r\\n\\r\\n    If I had to choose just one hat to wear, I\\u0027d call myself primarily a jazz violist.  Which is funny because I was such a reluctant jazz student initially.  I kept bringing in all these folk and classical guitar pieces to my teacher. Around age 15, and without warning, my high school orchestra teacher forced me to improvise a blues solo with the stage band before a live audience. I broke through the wall, and was on fire about jazz from then on.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusicians or persons who have heavily influenced your musical style and abilities?\\r\\n   \\r\\n      These artists especially because they never wore the straitjacket of any particular genre...\\r\\n\\r\\n    Pat Metheny, Oregon, Stephane Grapelli, Igor Stravinsky, Leonard Bernstein, Jean-Luc Ponty, The Beatles and Led Zeppelin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy Strings Attached? \\r\\n  I wanted a vehicle for my composing and arranging that wouldn\\u0027t require being on the road all the time.  I wanted to be around for my kids, and of course to be able to support them.   I didn\\u0027t have any idea back then how much work it would be to produce a concert series from the ground up.  But the idea of collaborating with amazing, locally popular folk artists in a way that would intermingle with my jazz and classical sensibilities was really exciting to me.  Strings Attached has become a musical playground for me, where folk and jazz and rock and classical all collide.  It\\u0027s like grafting the best of two or three plants together and coming up with something new, but traditional at the same time. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWho are the other members, their musical backgrounds? What each is their little spice that adds to the Strings Attached mix?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common thread of the founding members was everyone was a serious jazz player.  We wanted to  get away from the sort of jock playing mentality of straight ahead jazz; play more simply, with more space and dynamics. And put the focus on the song and the impact of its meaning. It was a nice change to face the audience more and perform more externally as opposed to approaching music more individually, and more inwardly.   These days we have a core of 10 or 12 players who are Strings Attached, in different configurations for different shows.   This works well in a number of ways: we can play to each person\\u0027s strengths by rotating them in and out specific shows. We stay fresh and absorb input from a bunch of members,  and very importantly: it helps us navigate trying to successfully schedule our very busy in-demand players! \\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the founding members: \\r\\n\\r\\n   Steve Zirkel  is a monster on bass, but started off as a trumpet player.  His muted jazz trumpet sound slapped up next to say, an early Joni Mitchell song, is a really defining element of our sound. He\\u0027s so fluent with his instruments and in general with the musical language, and thinks as fast as anyone I\\u0027ve ever played with.  I\\u0027ve known him for 22 years and we\\u0027ve developed a stage chemistry between us that is really satisfying.  We don\\u0027t even have to speak- we just follow each other intuitively.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Jason Mckenzie  plays a traditional drum kit with Billy Jo Shaver, but he helped create the Strings Attached sound with his exquisite hand percussion style.  His tabla and Indian Kanjira are an integral part of the recordings we\\u0027ve done. \\r\\n\\r\\n  Shawn Sanders and I were enjoying a beer on the front porch of my south Austin home when he suggested we remove the \\&quot;no\\&quot; of \\&quot;no strings attached.\\&quot; He has a PhD in cello performance, and has been with the Austin Lyric Opera about as long as I have.  He shows up to the table as good of a reader as anyone I could have asked for, and has been solid as the \\&quot;other\\&quot; primary bowed player of the group, allowing me to challenge my arranging skills. \\r\\n\\r\\nGlenn Rexach - In 1988 I served barbecue and beer to bikers for the C.B. Stubblefield. I first heard Glenn Rexach\\u0027s guitar and vocals tearing up the blues at the Sunday Stubbs Blues jam hosted by B3 player Dee Dee Purkepile.  I hired him to play bass for a jazz fusion bar gig and soon after discovered that Glenn had real experience playing Latin music, country, traditional and modern jazz, be-bop, funk, folk, hard rock, held a minor in music composition and was a rock solid fretless electric bass player in the Jaco Pastorius tradition. Glenn\\u0027s multifaceted guitar work makes it possible for me to present a vulnerable acoustic folk show one night and the music of Zeppelin the next.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat artists (National and local) have we worked with, and which ones have you especially enjoyed working with? \\r\\n\\r\\n   We\\u0027ve worked pretty regularly with both  Eliza Gilkyson and Slaid Cleaves, who were the first big local artists that helped get Strings Attached started.  Also (in no particular order) Shawn Colvin, Sara Hickman, Jimmy LaFave, Dar Williams,  Darden Smith, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Ian Moore, Patrice Pike, Abra Moore, and most recently Pearl Jam for their Austin City Limits taping.  (Complete List of Artists we\\u0027ve worked with)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat venues do we perform at? What type of atmosphere do we wish to perform in?\\r\\n  Like a lot of Austin musicians, we perform at a huge variety of venues in order to stay busy.  We love to play to a listening audience in a concert or festival setting, where people come specifically to focus on the music:  inspired solos and mistakes and all.  But we also enjoy the casual, low-pressure shows where we\\u0027re more of a backdrop. You can literally feel people unwinding from their work week.   We play at private parties and weddings, on rafts on Town Lake, in hospitals, around campfires,  you name it. \\r\\n \\r\\nAbout our audience?\\r\\n\\r\\n    We have a pretty big mailing list, and work hard to entice people to the shows.  The hard part is always getting them in the door the first time: once they see a show they tend to show up again, so there\\u0027s a fair amount of consistency in the faces we see. We also have several season ticket subscribers.  A large percentage of our fan base intersects with the opera/ballet-going audiences, who tend to be an older crowd and seem to respect the careful planning and heightened sense of event that we try to carry off with our formal series.  Then again, I\\u0027ve been noticing a lot of mixed ages at our classic rock shows, and we definitely want to cultivate that.  All our albums are listed on (website hidden)\\r\\n\\r\\n More on Strings Attached    One thing we get asked a lot is why we\\u0027re doing so many tribute shows.   Some of our die-hard fans worry that we\\u0027ll become more of a cover band.   But for us it\\u0027s never about recreating the music the same way your\\u0027e used to hearing it.  It\\u0027s about taking classic folk and rock artists- brilliant artists, and breathing something slightly innovative and interpretive into their music.   Exploring implied musical possibilities with a team of stellar players.  What a thrill!  I\\u0027ve gotten a lot of comments to the effect that our arrangements help people to really get the words of a song they\\u0027ve \\&quot;known\\&quot; forever.   There\\u0027s something about taking a song and putting some different jewelry on it, dressing it in a slightly different color, say, that can really shine a spotlight on the lyrics.  When you don\\u0027t hear the expected piano hook in John Lennon\\u0027s \\&quot;Imagine\\&quot;, you kind of perk your ears up in curiosity, as if you\\u0027re hearing this practically sacred song for the first time.  Lennon provided the genius source material; we\\u0027re just giving it some different shadows and light. And maybe a string of fresh water pearls. \\r\\n\\r\\n   I\\u0027m the luckiest guy in the world because I share a home with my sweetheart and music partner Karen Mal in a great little community in South Austin we call Woody\\u0027s Place.   For optimal family harmony I recommend back and foot rubs daily.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaylor\\u2019s work earned him Arranger of the Year, Jazz Artist of the Year, Best Viola, Best Acoustic Jazz Group, and Composer of the Year from the Clarksville Jazz Players and Critics Poll.&quot;, &quot;host_acceptance_rate&quot;: &quot;61%&quot;, &quot;host_has_profile_pic&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_id&quot;: 29654802, &quot;host_identity_verified&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_is_superhost&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;host_listings_count&quot;: 6.0, &quot;host_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, Texas, United States&quot;, &quot;host_name&quot;: &quot;Will&quot;, &quot;host_neighbourhood&quot;: null, &quot;host_picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/29654802/profile_pic/1426963817/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=225:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_response_rate&quot;: &quot;50%&quot;, &quot;host_response_time&quot;: &quot;within a day&quot;, &quot;host_since&quot;: &quot;2015-03-19&quot;, &quot;host_thumbnail_url&quot;: &quot;https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/29654802/profile_pic/1426963817/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=50:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_total_listings_count&quot;: 6.0, &quot;host_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/29654802&quot;, &quot;host_verifications&quot;: &quot;[\\u0027email\\u0027, \\u0027phone\\u0027, \\u0027facebook\\u0027, \\u0027google\\u0027, \\u0027linkedin\\u0027, \\u0027reviews\\u0027, \\u0027jumio\\u0027]&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 5719541, &quot;index_right&quot;: 0, &quot;instant_bookable&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;is_location_exact&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;jurisdiction_names&quot;: null, &quot;last_review&quot;: &quot;2015-10-22&quot;, &quot;last_scraped&quot;: &quot;2015-11-08&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;: 30.15722221329441, &quot;license&quot;: null, &quot;listing_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5719541&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;: -97.81915773929563, &quot;market&quot;: &quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;maximum_nights&quot;: 30, &quot;medium_url&quot;: &quot;https://a2.muscache.com/im/pictures/71287603/56597cd6_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium&quot;, &quot;minimum_nights&quot;: 2, &quot;monthly_price&quot;: &quot;$500.00&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Private Room(s) in Artist Community&quot;, &quot;neighborhood_overview&quot;: &quot;Quiet neighborhood with large lots near a best kept secret park.

As much as I love the city, I also enjoy traveling and photographing vacation destinations and tourist attractions around the world. As a registered travel agent, I am able to work while I enjoy tours and activities in places like London, Paris, Rome, New York, San Francisco, and Hawaii, to name a few.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have always wanted to own/operate a hotel.  That has been a passion of mine since I was a child.  For that reason, I enjoy having guests staying in my rental properties, and I want to provide so much more than just a place to stay.  My goal is to create a memorable experience for my guests.  I want my guests to know that not only does Austin deliver a good time, but that this home away from home is waiting for you.  With my connections in the travel industry, and tenure in the city, I strive to provide a level of service you will not find with other rental managers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease feel free to ask as many questions as you like.  I enjoy talking about Austin and the property, so I welcome you to communicate with me.  I am here to help, and your good time is my priority.&quot;, &quot;host_acceptance_rate&quot;: &quot;90%&quot;, &quot;host_has_profile_pic&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_id&quot;: 4929310, &quot;host_identity_verified&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_is_superhost&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_listings_count&quot;: 21.0, &quot;host_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, Texas, United States&quot;, &quot;host_name&quot;: &quot;Ryan&quot;, &quot;host_neighbourhood&quot;: &quot;Downtown&quot;, &quot;host_picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a1.muscache.com/ac/users/4929310/profile_pic/1401069764/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=225:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_response_rate&quot;: &quot;100%&quot;, &quot;host_response_time&quot;: &quot;within a few hours&quot;, &quot;host_since&quot;: &quot;2013-02-01&quot;, &quot;host_thumbnail_url&quot;: &quot;https://a1.muscache.com/ac/users/4929310/profile_pic/1401069764/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=50:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_total_listings_count&quot;: 21.0, &quot;host_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/4929310&quot;, &quot;host_verifications&quot;: &quot;[\\u0027email\\u0027, \\u0027phone\\u0027, \\u0027facebook\\u0027, \\u0027linkedin\\u0027, \\u0027reviews\\u0027, \\u0027kba\\u0027]&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1570491, &quot;index_right&quot;: 0, &quot;instant_bookable&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;is_location_exact&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;jurisdiction_names&quot;: null, &quot;last_review&quot;: &quot;2015-10-24&quot;, &quot;last_scraped&quot;: &quot;2015-11-08&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;: 30.26489709307223, &quot;license&quot;: null, &quot;listing_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1570491&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;: -97.74244432255114, &quot;market&quot;: &quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;maximum_nights&quot;: 1095, &quot;medium_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/24551138/ea763899_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium&quot;, &quot;minimum_nights&quot;: 1, &quot;monthly_price&quot;: null, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;The Argyle Suite/Loft on 4th Street&quot;, &quot;neighborhood_overview&quot;: &quot;I love that the downtown neighborhood is so vibrant, and provides the ability to walk to the best restaurants, bars, shopping, and nightlife in Austin.

Low ceilings. Not recommended for guests over 6 ft tall. We know that narrows the guests that would be able to stay and we are really sorry for that.  2. Water. All water is sourced from a garden hose and uses a grey water collection bucket around back to reuse for the surrounding plants. We care about out water usage and this allows us to recycle the water we do use and keep our impact low.  3. Outdoor Shower. Yes, thats right. The best part is showing under the stars at night. Shower is equipped with a curtain for privacy and a towel holder to cover yourself on your way back inside.

Another constant of this particular address is its location that offers rapid public transit within a half to block-long walks at either end of its street. There is also convenient access to all major thoroughfares in and around the city. Walking and bike friendly routes connect our well-established neighborhoods: Brentwood, north; Allandale; west; Rosedale, south; and North Loop, east through to HydePark and the UT campus area, south. The North Lamar to Burnet Road commercial corridor offers unparalleled convenience and affordability in meeting one\\u0027s daily needs for a short-term stay in town. We rate a pedestrian friendly score of 75, but that becomes a moot point in 100-plus degree summer heat. Instead, keep in mind that you can drive quite directly to the city\\u0027s best naturally cold waters of Barton Springs and Deep Eddy Pools via MoPac, or head north on Shoal Creek Blvd.&quot;, &quot;neighbourhood&quot;: &quot;Brentwood&quot;, &quot;neighbourhood_cleansed&quot;: 78756, &quot;neighbourhood_group_cleansed&quot;: null, &quot;notes&quot;: &quot;Please pack: a bath towel or two, and soft shoes to wear indoors. &quot;, &quot;number_of_reviews&quot;: 1, &quot;picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/4873651/118e4504_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026size=large_cover\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: 300.0, &quot;property_type&quot;: &quot;House&quot;, &quot;require_guest_phone_verification&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;require_guest_profile_picture&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;requires_license&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;review_scores_accuracy&quot;: 8.0, &quot;review_scores_checkin&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_cleanliness&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_communication&quot;: 8.0, &quot;review_scores_location&quot;: 8.0, &quot;review_scores_rating&quot;: 89.0, &quot;review_scores_value&quot;: 8.0, &quot;reviews_per_month&quot;: 0.02, &quot;room_type&quot;: &quot;Private room&quot;, &quot;scrape_id&quot;: 20151107173015, &quot;security_deposit&quot;: &quot;$1,000.00&quot;, &quot;smart_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, TX&quot;, &quot;space&quot;: &quot;The 1450 sq ft house has a traditional versus open concept layout that maximizes space and privacy within its modest sized rooms.

I look forward to practically anything outdoors and fortunately I\\u0027m rarely disappointed. I enjoy traveling every occasion possible. I\\u0027ve recently down sized into a duplex and am digging the freedom.  I look forward to adventures in traveling and trying/learning new things. There are a minimum of 5 ongoing projects in my life at all times and with so much to experience in life there\\u0027s so little time to squeeze it all in. But it\\u0027s fun trying!\\r\\nMy favorite travel location so far is Costa Rica though the US has so much to offer for exploring. \\r\\nI prefer to stay in a house/condo vs a hotel. The idea of having a safe comfortable provisioned \\u0027home-base\\u0027 from which to explore and return to is a huge draw. Plus I feel more connected to the life of the area which adds more dimension to the experience. I like to plan 70% of a trip allowing 30% for unexpected adventure. When I travel I\\u0027m conscious of those around me and those who provide services for me; try to act on The Golden Rule. I enjoy catching glimpses into the lives of newly met friends. \\r\\nPositive attracts and creates Positive. &quot;, &quot;host_acceptance_rate&quot;: &quot;75%&quot;, &quot;host_has_profile_pic&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_id&quot;: 20278926, &quot;host_identity_verified&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_is_superhost&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_listings_count&quot;: 1.0, &quot;host_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, Texas, United States&quot;, &quot;host_name&quot;: &quot;Melissa&quot;, &quot;host_neighbourhood&quot;: &quot;MLK \\u0026 183&quot;, &quot;host_picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a1.muscache.com/ac/users/20278926/profile_pic/1412617617/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=225:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_response_rate&quot;: &quot;100%&quot;, &quot;host_response_time&quot;: &quot;within a few hours&quot;, &quot;host_since&quot;: &quot;2014-08-19&quot;, &quot;host_thumbnail_url&quot;: &quot;https://a1.muscache.com/ac/users/20278926/profile_pic/1412617617/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=50:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_total_listings_count&quot;: 1.0, &quot;host_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/20278926&quot;, &quot;host_verifications&quot;: &quot;[\\u0027email\\u0027, \\u0027phone\\u0027, \\u0027facebook\\u0027, \\u0027reviews\\u0027, \\u0027jumio\\u0027, \\u0027kba\\u0027]&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 4226453, &quot;index_right&quot;: 0, &quot;instant_bookable&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;is_location_exact&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;jurisdiction_names&quot;: null, &quot;last_review&quot;: &quot;2015-10-20&quot;, &quot;last_scraped&quot;: &quot;2015-11-08&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;: 30.273935917201506, &quot;license&quot;: null, &quot;listing_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/4226453&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;: -97.67974470179892, &quot;market&quot;: &quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;maximum_nights&quot;: 1125, &quot;medium_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/67246191/1cbf96b7_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium&quot;, &quot;minimum_nights&quot;: 1, &quot;monthly_price&quot;: &quot;$1,811.00&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Cute \\u0026 Quirky - Close to So Much!&quot;, &quot;neighborhood_overview&quot;: &quot;I\\u0027ve only lived here for 2 months and I love my neighborhood.

I want my guests to share my love for this amazing city, and to find belonging in a home away from home. Let my 8 years of experience here be your key to navigating Austin like a local. \\r\\n\\r\\nI deeply believe in investing in quality. My philosophy guides how I host, so I approach Airbnb as an art and a science. Travel is more than just being in another place, and Airbnb is more than just a place to stay. My goal is to be a professional host, but my priority is to give you a real human experience!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\&quot;Don\\u0027t ever let someone tell you, you can\\u0027t do something. Not even me. You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can\\u0027t do something themselves, they wanna tell you that you can\\u0027t do it. \\&quot;\\r\\n- The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;, &quot;host_acceptance_rate&quot;: &quot;89%&quot;, &quot;host_has_profile_pic&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_id&quot;: 4913398, &quot;host_identity_verified&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_is_superhost&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;host_listings_count&quot;: 6.0, &quot;host_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, Texas, United States&quot;, &quot;host_name&quot;: &quot;Jeddy&quot;, &quot;host_neighbourhood&quot;: &quot;West Campus&quot;, &quot;host_picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/4913398/profile_pic/1409126085/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=225:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_response_rate&quot;: &quot;88%&quot;, &quot;host_response_time&quot;: &quot;within an hour&quot;, &quot;host_since&quot;: &quot;2013-01-30&quot;, &quot;host_thumbnail_url&quot;: &quot;https://a2.muscache.com/ac/users/4913398/profile_pic/1409126085/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=50:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_total_listings_count&quot;: 6.0, &quot;host_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/4913398&quot;, &quot;host_verifications&quot;: &quot;[\\u0027email\\u0027, \\u0027phone\\u0027, \\u0027facebook\\u0027, \\u0027google\\u0027, \\u0027linkedin\\u0027, \\u0027reviews\\u0027, \\u0027kba\\u0027]&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 3863473, &quot;index_right&quot;: 0, &quot;instant_bookable&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;is_location_exact&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;jurisdiction_names&quot;: null, &quot;last_review&quot;: &quot;2015-10-24&quot;, &quot;last_scraped&quot;: &quot;2015-11-08&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;: 30.284981787716863, &quot;license&quot;: null, &quot;listing_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3863473&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;: -97.74568462411142, &quot;market&quot;: &quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;maximum_nights&quot;: 1125, &quot;medium_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/59368284/c9ae321f_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium&quot;, &quot;minimum_nights&quot;: 1, &quot;monthly_price&quot;: null, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;5\\u2605.

Frequently Asked: Q.) What is the total price with fees and all?  A.) Total Price = (Rental Price + Extra guest fee per night) * Nights booked + Cleaning fee Q.) You are listed as having a Entire Space. What exactly does that mean?  A.) An Entire Space listing has the highest level of privacy. There are residents that live in the apartment when you aren\\u0027t visiting but they are gone when you stay. Myself included. During your stay, we (the residents) spend time out at our other place. We are quiet and polite. Q.) How do I find the apartment?  A.) The pre-arrival packet (including complete directions and check-in instructions) will be e-mail to guests as early as four to five days prior to check-in. Q.) Why is there a cleaning fee?  A.)

I love Austin, almost as much as I love traveling!  \\r\\nI\\u0027ve lived here about 5 years, teaching yoga, enjoying the loveliness this city has to offer.  But I\\u0027ve started traveling and teaching more around the country and overseas so I\\u0027m out more and more.  \\r\\nI adore Europe, but have spent a ton of time in Asia, and Japan is one of my absolute favorites, due to it\\u0027s beauty and weirdness.  Also love Vietnam, and look forward to exploring more!  \\r\\nIndia is also dear to my heart. . .

In sight of the skyline, yet adjacent to a wilderness park.  The most wonderful thing about our unit is the three minute walk to Barton Springs Pool. The naturally spring-fed pool maintains its natural surroundings but has been dammed up to form an enormous swimming area. Many agree that it is easily the best swimming hole in Texas. We are also convenient to a number of parks as well as bars and cafes on Barton Springs road, and the beautiful and famous Lady Bird Lake hiking path, which you can walk or bike to the pedestrian bridge toward downtown. There are slightly more rugged and very impressive hikes through the Zilker greenbelt that have wonderful and varied natural scenery nearby as well.   &quot;, &quot;neighbourhood&quot;: &quot;Barton Hills&quot;, &quot;neighbourhood_cleansed&quot;: 78704, &quot;neighbourhood_group_cleansed&quot;: null, &quot;notes&quot;: &quot;This is a convenient place to get access to central Austin for a weekend.

I work in the film/television world, and Pete is a woodworker who does custom cabinetry and fine furniture. We both love a good project and have been slowly transforming our house into a cool and efficient space. We have a mostly-outdoor cat named Charlie, who doesn\\u0027t use a litter box (in the good way- he goes outside) and is low key as long as he has a constant supply of food. We also have backyard chickens, so hopefully if you stay with us you can eat some fresh eggs while you\\u0027re here.

We have always stayed in B \\u0026Bs  all over Europe and each experience was unique and fun.  We rarely make reservations early but find a place when we get to our destination and I can report it has always worked for us because of the way European travel works.   My philosophy is that \\&quot;if I am not sure where I am going to be every minute, I am never lost and never late\\&quot;........that is what I consider a vacation.

I grew up and went to college in Charleston Illinois. After 23 years of crappy Midwestern weather, I picked up and moved to Austin. What a breath of life this town has been. I\\u0027ve been fortunate to find wonderful friends who love music and travel as much as I do. And have fallen in love with this city because of its relaxed nature and friendliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my spare time, I go to as many live shows as possible. I love to be on the lake or out in the sun in any manner of the phrase. I love animals, though do not own any myself. I like to get involved in a good tv series and can often be found on my couch on a rainy day watching HBO or Netflix. I love shopping for and listening to records. There\\u0027s a great thrill in the hunt for a classic record in the used section. I also like to eat. A lot. Queso practically pumps through my veins. I don\\u0027t drink much, but love to go out with my friends anyway. \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u0027m a pretty clean person. It\\u0027s hard for me to function in an cluttered environment. Though you wouldn\\u0027t know it by looking at my desk at work. I work at a law firm in West Lake Hills, west of Austin.

We have lived in Central East Austin for about six years. We enjoy our neighborhood and want you to experience everything Austin has to offer from great restaurants and entertainment to  SXSW, ACL, X Games and Formula 1. Our dog Azore loves guests and will often greet them with barks followed by licks. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur favorite thing to do on a Sunday morning is to walk the dog on the hike and bike trail, stop at the Rowing Center to enjoy the view of the lake, then have breakfast at Jo\\u0027s Coffee on West 2nd Street and walk back home through downtown. Cenote, which is just three blocks away is our neighborhood staple. It\\u0027s great for breakfast, lunch and dinner and offers a nice beer and wine list. If you are up for a walk, head over to East End Wines, order a bottle of wine and dine from the trailer in the parking lot - Three Little Pigs. It\\u0027s one of my favorite outings.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me know what you are interested in and I am happy to offer suggestions. This city is lots of fun and I would love to help you maximize your enjoyment!\\r\\n\\r\\nBrooke with Emerson Guest Properties manages my rentals for me.

    "Results are largely unsurprising, but nonetheless reassuring. Both an extra bedroom and an extra bathroom increase the final price around 30%. Accounting for those, an extra bed pushes the price about 2%. Neither the number of guests included nor the number of listings the host has in total have a significant effect on the final price.\n",

    "Including a spatial weights object in the regression buys you an extra bit: the summary provides results on the diagnostics for spatial dependence. These are a series of statistics that test whether the residuals of the regression are spatially correlated, against the null of a random distribution over space. If the latter is rejected a key assumption of OLS, independently distributed error terms, is violated. Depending on the structure of the spatial pattern, different strategies have been defined within the spatial econometrics literature to deal with them. The main summary from the diagnostics for spatial dependence is that there is clear evidence to reject the null of spatial randomness in the residuals, hence an explicitly spatial approach is warranted.\n",

    "## Spatially lagged exogenous regressors (`WX`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most straightforward way to introduce space is by **\"spatially lagging\" one of the explanatory variables**. Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ln(P_i) = \\alpha + \\beta X_i + \\delta \\sum_j w_{ij} X'_i + \\epsilon_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\ln(P_i)$ is our dependent variable (logarithmic price), $X'_i$ is a subset of $X_i$, although it could encompass all of the explanatory variables, and $w_{ij}$ is the $ij$-th cell of a spatial weights matrix $W$. Because $W$ assigns non-zero values only to spatial neighbors, if $W$ is row-standardized (customary in this context), then $\\sum_j w_{ij} X'_i$ captures the average value of $X'_i$ in the surroundings of location $i$. This is what we call the *spatial lag* of $X_i$. Also, since it is a spatial transformation of an explanatory variable, the standard estimation approach -OLS- is sufficient: spatially lagging the variables does not violate any of the assumptions on which OLS relies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we will want to spatially lag variables that we think may affect the price of a house in a given location. For example, one could think that pools represent a visual amenity. If that is the case, then listed properties surrounded by other properties with pools might, everything else equal, be more expensive. To calculate the number of pools surrounding each property, we can build an alternative weights matrix that we do not row-standardize:"

    "Results are largely consistent with the original model. Also, incidentally, the number of pools surrounding a property does not appear to have any significant effect on the price of a given property. This could be for a host of reasons: maybe AirBnb customers do not value the number of pools surrounding a property where they are looking to stay; but maybe they do but our dataset only allows us to capture the number of pools in *other* AirBnb properties, which is not necessarily a good proxy of the number of pools in the immediate surroundings of a given property.\n",

    "1. Unlike before, this specification *does* violate some of the assumptions on which OLS relies. In particular, it is including an endogenous variable $\\ln(P_i)$ on the right-hand side. This means we need a new estimation method to obtain reliable coefficients. The technical details of this go well beyond the scope of this tutorial. But we can offload those to `PySAL` and use the `GM_Lag` class, which implements the state-of-the-art approach to estimate this model.\n",
    "1. A more conceptual *gotcha*: you might be tempted to read the equation above as the effect of the price in neighboring locations $j$ on that of location $i$. This is not exactly the exact interpretation. Instead, we need to realize this is all assumed to be a \"joint decission\": rather than some houses setting their price first and that having a subsequent effect on others, what the equation models is an interdependent process by which each owner sets her own price *taking into account* the price that will be set in neighboring locations. This might read a bit like a technical subtlety and, to some extent, it is; but it is important to keep it in mind when you are interpreting the results.\n",
