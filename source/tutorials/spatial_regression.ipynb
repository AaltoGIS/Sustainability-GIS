    "This notebook covers a brief and gentle introduction to spatial econometrics in Python. To do that, we will use a set of Austin properties listed in AirBnb.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of spatial econometrics is to introduce a formal representation of space into the statistical framework for regression. This can be done in many ways: by including predictors based on space (e.g. distance to relevant features), by splitting the datasets into subsets that map into different geographical regions (e.g. [spatial regimes](http://pysal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/spreg/regimes.html)), by exploiting close distance to other observations to borrow information in the estimation (e.g. [kriging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging)), or by introducing variables that put in relation their value at a given location with those in nearby locations, to give a few examples. Some of these approaches can be implemented with standard non-spatial techniques, while others require bespoke models that can deal with the issues introduced. In this short tutorial, we will focus on the latter group. In particular, we will introduce some of the most commonly used methods in the field of spatial econometrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example we will use to demonstrate this draws on hedonic house price modelling. This a well-established methodology that was developed by [Rosen (1974)](https://www.sonoma.edu/users/c/cuellar/econ421/rosen-hedonic.pdf) that is capable of recovering the marginal willingness to pay for goods or services that are not traded in the market. In other words, this allows us to put an implicit price on things such as living close to a park or in a neighborhood with good quality of air. In addition, since hedonic models are based on linear regression, the technique can also be used to obtain predictions of house prices.\n",

Walking distance for the main SXSW event grounds and South Congress or a 5 min cab or Uber ride to downtown Austin. It is a loved home! This apartment has been the best home for the past 8 years.

I love to travel, and love meeting new people so Airbnb is a perfect fit for me. I discovered Airbnb with a bunch of friends on a trip to Denver and had such an amazing experience I am trying my hand at hosting. I have a yellow lab who likes to travel with me when she can, play the guitar a little (me not my dog), read everything that crosses my path, and generally try to be a low maintenance kinda gal. I am currently working for a psychiatrist but have worked in veterinary medicine for the last ten years. I am working on mastering Spanish and have loved traveling in Spain and Guatemala.  &quot;, &quot;host_acceptance_rate&quot;: null, &quot;host_has_profile_pic&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_id&quot;: 5181260, &quot;host_identity_verified&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_is_superhost&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;host_listings_count&quot;: 1.0, &quot;host_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, Texas, United States&quot;, &quot;host_name&quot;: &quot;Sarah&quot;, &quot;host_neighbourhood&quot;: &quot;Travis Heights&quot;, &quot;host_picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/ac/users/5181260/profile_pic/1361513361/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=225:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_response_rate&quot;: null, &quot;host_response_time&quot;: null, &quot;host_since&quot;: &quot;2013-02-22&quot;, &quot;host_thumbnail_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/ac/users/5181260/profile_pic/1361513361/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=50:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_total_listings_count&quot;: 1.0, &quot;host_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/5181260&quot;, &quot;host_verifications&quot;: &quot;[\\u0027email\\u0027, \\u0027phone\\u0027, \\u0027facebook\\u0027, \\u0027linkedin\\u0027, \\u0027reviews\\u0027, \\u0027kba\\u0027]&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 5262460, &quot;index_right&quot;: 0, &quot;instant_bookable&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;is_location_exact&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;jurisdiction_names&quot;: null, &quot;last_review&quot;: &quot;2015-03-23&quot;, &quot;last_scraped&quot;: &quot;2015-11-08&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;: 30.241630058705905, &quot;license&quot;: null, &quot;listing_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5262460&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;: -97.73864573547654, &quot;market&quot;: &quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;maximum_nights&quot;: 8, &quot;medium_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/67816239/33376345_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium&quot;, &quot;minimum_nights&quot;: 1, &quot;monthly_price&quot;: null, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Great One Bedroom For SXSW&quot;, &quot;neighborhood_overview&quot;: &quot;Travis Heights is a beautiful neighborhood, full of incredible homes that range from 4,000 square foot modern new builds, and two bedroom cottages with tons of personality.

My life\\u0027s purpose; Every conversation I have with anyone leaves them with a new opening for action and a new possibility they didn\\u0027t see before we spoke.  I did the EST Training in 1982 which altered my life forever and I continue to engage in Landmark Worldwide programs as a way to continue my commitment to lifelong learning.  I am direct, open and enjoy people; am independent and open minded, probably a bit on the liberal side and I like to live and travel comfortably whenever possible. I strive for integrity in all things and look forward to meeting new people and having new, positive experiences.

We are also convenient to a number of parks as well as bars and cafes on Barton Springs road, and the beautiful and famous Lady Bird Lake hiking path, which you can walk or bike to the pedestrian bridge toward downtown.

Raised in San Diego, CA. Found myself in Tibet. Got lost in University. Found my first self in Melbourne. Became a Web Developer in Chicago.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u0027m a California transplant in Austin. Now I work as a software engineer for an established startup here in town. \\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\u0027t smoke. I don\\u0027t have any pets, but love cats and dogs. I continue to struggle to be an early bird, but like to burn the candle at both ends. In my free time, I try to live a healthy lifestyle, staying active in all that there is to do in Austin. I\\u0027m a big fan of events and socializing. Yet, when I\\u0027m at home I prefer less chaos more peace. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a day of sitting in front of a computer I prefer to spend time chatting with my friends. I keep a clean house, let\\u0027s hope you do too. I enjoy cooking and friends. Yet, I\\u0027m always am respectful of working or sleeping hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my free time I like to explore. I\\u0027ll find local volunteering opportunities, having worked keeping Beer Festivals green and Film Projectors spinning. I enjoy the cool halls of a museum, as long as you don\\u0027t mind me poking fun at Modern Art. I\\u0027ll share a classy cocktail or craft beer, but I\\u0027m a coffee fan first and foremost.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u0027ve got a big thing for getting outside, and though my job keeps me ball-and-chained to my computer, I\\u0027d run, jump, hike, swim and skateboard to enjoy my nights and weekends.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u0027m clean and courteous, I like to cook and happy to help around my community. I know I\\u0027m a new airbnb, but I always do my best to make a great first impression.\\r\\n\\r\\nPHILOSOPHY\\r\\n\\r\\nChallenge myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLive for my dreams.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can do it if you think you can.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpward momentum.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall changes, make all the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep&quot;, &quot;host_acceptance_rate&quot;: &quot;67%&quot;, &quot;host_has_profile_pic&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_id&quot;: 417523, &quot;host_identity_verified&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_is_superhost&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;host_listings_count&quot;: 1.0, &quot;host_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, Texas, United States&quot;, &quot;host_name&quot;: &quot;Oli&quot;, &quot;host_neighbourhood&quot;: &quot;Brentwood&quot;, &quot;host_picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a1.muscache.com/ac/users/417523/profile_pic/1433214460/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=225:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_response_rate&quot;: &quot;80%&quot;, &quot;host_response_time&quot;: &quot;within a day&quot;, &quot;host_since&quot;: &quot;2011-03-01&quot;, &quot;host_thumbnail_url&quot;: &quot;https://a1.muscache.com/ac/users/417523/profile_pic/1433214460/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=50:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_total_listings_count&quot;: 1.0, &quot;host_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/417523&quot;, &quot;host_verifications&quot;: &quot;[\\u0027email\\u0027, \\u0027phone\\u0027, \\u0027facebook\\u0027, \\u0027google\\u0027, \\u0027linkedin\\u0027, \\u0027reviews\\u0027, \\u0027jumio\\u0027]&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 6645530, &quot;index_right&quot;: 0, &quot;instant_bookable&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;is_location_exact&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;jurisdiction_names&quot;: null, &quot;last_review&quot;: &quot;2015-09-23&quot;, &quot;last_scraped&quot;: &quot;2015-11-08&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;: 30.31883267879668, &quot;license&quot;: null, &quot;listing_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6645530&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;: -97.73002723452528, &quot;market&quot;: &quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;maximum_nights&quot;: 4, &quot;medium_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/83771370/2e8fb19b_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium&quot;, &quot;minimum_nights&quot;: 1, &quot;monthly_price&quot;: null, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;\\u0027Hollywood\\u0027 suite close to Downtown&quot;, &quot;neighborhood_overview&quot;: null, &quot;neighbourhood&quot;: &quot;Brentwood&quot;, &quot;neighbourhood_cleansed&quot;: 78751, &quot;neighbourhood_group_cleansed&quot;: null, &quot;notes&quot;: null, &quot;number_of_reviews&quot;: 3, &quot;picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/ac/pictures/83771370/2e8fb19b_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026size=large_cover\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: 40.0, &quot;property_type&quot;: &quot;Apartment&quot;, &quot;require_guest_phone_verification&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;require_guest_profile_picture&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;requires_license&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;review_scores_accuracy&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_checkin&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_cleanliness&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_communication&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_location&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_rating&quot;: 100.0, &quot;review_scores_value&quot;: 10.0, &quot;reviews_per_month&quot;: 1.02, &quot;room_type&quot;: &quot;Shared room&quot;, &quot;scrape_id&quot;: 20151107173015, &quot;security_deposit&quot;: null, &quot;smart_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, TX&quot;, &quot;space&quot;: &quot;The Space If you\\u0027re not familiar with Austin, Hyde Park is north of the UT campus.

Since moving from CO 3 years ago, I\\u0027ve purchased 2 pairs of cowboy boots, have taken up two-stepping, firearm ownership, and river floating as my favorite sport. Miss the snow, but have grown accustomed to the heat in TX. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy hope for airBnB is to offer respectable, like-minded individuals the opportunity to see Austin in all of it\\u0027s polished and unpolished glory. My neighborhood has afforded me a lot of rich history and culture and beyond the established tourist trail.

Galindo is a rapidly gentrifying area where humble bungalows are being replaced by larger modern homes, many of them custom builds by interesting architects. Our house was one of the first modern custom homes in the area, built about ten years ago. The guest cottage is the original structure that was on the property -- a 1920s classic Austin bungalow. Bouldin Creek, the neighborhood immediately to our north, is the heart of all things cool about South Austin -- amazing architecture, food, you name it. We\\u0027re on a corner lot across the street from a large park with a beautiful (and ridiculously cheap) tennis center with 10 courts, a playground, ball fields, etc. Within a few minutes you can walk to some of the best tacos in town, great coffee shops, a gi&quot;, &quot;neighbourhood&quot;: &quot;Galindo&quot;, &quot;neighbourhood_cleansed&quot;: 78704, &quot;neighbourhood_group_cleansed&quot;: null, &quot;notes&quot;: null, &quot;number_of_reviews&quot;: 38, &quot;picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a2.muscache.com/ac/pictures/62558085/686dd9be_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026size=large_cover\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: 105.0, &quot;property_type&quot;: &quot;House&quot;, &quot;require_guest_phone_verification&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;require_guest_profile_picture&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;requires_license&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;review_scores_accuracy&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_checkin&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_cleanliness&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_communication&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_location&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_rating&quot;: 97.0, &quot;review_scores_value&quot;: 9.0, &quot;reviews_per_month&quot;: 4.06, &quot;room_type&quot;: &quot;Entire home/apt&quot;, &quot;scrape_id&quot;: 20151107173015, &quot;security_deposit&quot;: &quot;$200.00&quot;, &quot;smart_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, TX&quot;, &quot;space&quot;: &quot;This charming bungalow is situated next door to our house, with direct access from the street, a dedicated parking spot, and private entrance.

From jazz, blues, and country to rock, hip-hop, beat, progressive, metal, punk and derivations of these, there\\u2019s something to whet everyone\\u2019s musical palette.

There is a washer/dryer, dishwasher and full kitchen. The master bedroom has an on-suite bath with a queen-sized bed.  The second bedroom has one queen bed.  The third bedroom is an office.  Sleeps at least 4, but I have a couch that comfortably holds one more and a blow up mattress is available. We are located 4 blocks from the MLK train station, 2 miles from downtown, 10 minutes to the airport and an easy bike ride to 6th Street.  A cab downtown is about $10; $20 to the airport.   I have two charcoal grills in the backyard and a bike you can use. This is an ideal spot for F1 visitors, with easy access to Airport Blvd, which takes you right to HW 71 and the race track.  It is also a great Eastside hangout for SXSW and ACL.  Lots of great local restaurants, coffee shops and bars nearby.   &quot;, &quot;square_feet&quot;: 1800.0, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;TX&quot;, &quot;street&quot;: &quot;Mc Kinley Ave, Austin, TX 78702, United States&quot;, &quot;summary&quot;: null, &quot;thumbnail_url&quot;: &quot;https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/22189339/47ab9206_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026size=small\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;transit&quot;: null, &quot;weekly_price&quot;: null, &quot;xl_picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/22189339/47ab9206_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026size=x_large_cover\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;zipcode&quot;: 78702.0}, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Feature&quot;}, {&quot;bbox&quot;: [-97.71845998620172, 30.42673597400724, -97.71845998620172, 30.42673597400724], &quot;geometry&quot;: {&quot;coordinates&quot;: [-97.71845998620172, 30.42673597400724], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Point&quot;}, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5632&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: {&quot;__folium_color&quot;: &quot;#e32f27&quot;, &quot;accommodates&quot;: 2, &quot;amenities&quot;: &quot;{TV,Internet,\\&quot;Wireless Internet\\&quot;,\\&quot;Air Conditioning\\&quot;,Pool,Kitchen,\\&quot;Free Parking on Premises\\&quot;,\\&quot;Pets live on this property\\&quot;,Cat(s),\\&quot;Other pet(s)\\&quot;,\\&quot;Hot Tub\\&quot;,Heating,Washer,Dryer,\\&quot;Smoke Detector\\&quot;,\\&quot;First Aid Kit\\&quot;,\\&quot;Safety Card\\&quot;,Essentials,Shampoo}&quot;, &quot;availability_30&quot;: 30, &quot;availability_365&quot;: 365, &quot;availability_60&quot;: 60, &quot;availability_90&quot;: 90, &quot;bathrooms&quot;: 1.0, &quot;bed_type&quot;: &quot;Real Bed&quot;, &quot;bedrooms&quot;: 1.0, &quot;beds&quot;: 1.0, &quot;calculated_host_listings_count&quot;: 1, &quot;calendar_last_scraped&quot;: &quot;2015-11-07&quot;, &quot;calendar_updated&quot;: &quot;6 months ago&quot;, &quot;cancellation_policy&quot;: &quot;moderate&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;cleaning_fee&quot;: null, &quot;country&quot;: &quot;United States&quot;, &quot;country_code&quot;: &quot;US&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Our suburban home near Parmer and Mopac is close to the train station that will take you to the heart of downtown.

My style is casual, but I still make the bed every day.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u0027m a big fan of trees and greenery, so I like to stay at places that have some nature close-by- a pretty back yard or even a park nearby will do the trick.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\u0027m mostly vegetarian- still can\\u0027t give up bacon or sausage and cheese kolaches though. &quot;, &quot;host_acceptance_rate&quot;: null, &quot;host_has_profile_pic&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_id&quot;: 734034, &quot;host_identity_verified&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_is_superhost&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;host_listings_count&quot;: 1.0, &quot;host_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, Texas, United States&quot;, &quot;host_name&quot;: &quot;Stacy M&quot;, &quot;host_neighbourhood&quot;: null, &quot;host_picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/ac/users/734034/profile_pic/1308812863/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=225:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_response_rate&quot;: null, &quot;host_response_time&quot;: null, &quot;host_since&quot;: &quot;2011-06-23&quot;, &quot;host_thumbnail_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/ac/users/734034/profile_pic/1308812863/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=50:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_total_listings_count&quot;: 1.0, &quot;host_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/734034&quot;, &quot;host_verifications&quot;: &quot;[\\u0027email\\u0027, \\u0027phone\\u0027, \\u0027reviews\\u0027, \\u0027kba\\u0027]&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 1703081, &quot;index_right&quot;: 0, &quot;instant_bookable&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;is_location_exact&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;jurisdiction_names&quot;: null, &quot;last_review&quot;: null, &quot;last_scraped&quot;: &quot;2015-11-08&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;: 30.42673597400724, &quot;license&quot;: null, &quot;listing_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1703081&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;: -97.71845998620172, &quot;market&quot;: &quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;maximum_nights&quot;: 7, &quot;medium_url&quot;: null, &quot;minimum_nights&quot;: 1, &quot;monthly_price&quot;: null, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;North Austin house w.pool/hot tub&quot;, &quot;neighborhood_overview&quot;: &quot;We\\u0027re in a quiet, tree-lined suburban neighborhood.

Being the closest residential neighborhood to downtown, the pedi-cabs will deliver you after a night out open-air to your doorstep.&quot;, &quot;number_of_reviews&quot;: 46, &quot;picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/ac/pictures/25870369/4d600f87_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026size=large_cover\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: 500.0, &quot;property_type&quot;: &quot;House&quot;, &quot;require_guest_phone_verification&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;require_guest_profile_picture&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;requires_license&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;review_scores_accuracy&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_checkin&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_cleanliness&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_communication&quot;: 10.0, &quot;review_scores_location&quot;: 9.0, &quot;review_scores_rating&quot;: 99.0, &quot;review_scores_value&quot;: 9.0, &quot;reviews_per_month&quot;: 0.95, &quot;room_type&quot;: &quot;Entire home/apt&quot;, &quot;scrape_id&quot;: 20151107173015, &quot;security_deposit&quot;: &quot;$500.00&quot;, &quot;smart_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, TX&quot;, &quot;space&quot;: &quot;Originally built in 1899, this gem of East Austin has 10 foot ceilings, a Dutch beamed ceiling in the dining room and imported Egyptian globe chanderlier, lovely bead-board \\u0026 period trim throughout.

I now call lovely Austin my home for a little over a year. Besides some warm summers, there is not much to complain about. I love this city! \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can often find me out and about exploring and being active. I enjoy biking the 10 mile trail around downtown, town lake/lady bird lake or hiking and getting lost in the massive green belt just west of town. I also enjoy wake boarding at Lake Austin and Lake Travis!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is rare that you will find me cooking at home. All my favorite things to eat (pizza, breakfast tacos, BBQ, tex mex and beer) are within walking distance to Navasota house!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are just so many great restaurants and things to do in Austin, I\\u2019ll probably never be able to get to all of them, but I think I\\u0027m off to a great start. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also love to travel. I have lived in seven states and short stays abroad in Costa Rica and Sweden. I have visited 35 countries as well over the years. I live for adventure and meeting new people wherever I go. I think Austin has some of the friendliest and most interesting people to meet! \\r\\n\\r\\nI am so excited to share my love of this Navasota home, its fabulous location and our amazing city with you. I even printed out a binder that stays at the house and has all my favorite restaurants/bars and things to do all typed out. There are copies for you to take since I know recommendations can make all the difference when visiting a new city! I want people to experience what I have been lucky enough to experience so far in Austin and truly believe this home and it\\u2019s location are the best here in Austin. \\r\\n\\r\\nHave fun, travel safe and keep it weird :)\\r\\nIsaac\\r\\n&quot;, &quot;host_acceptance_rate&quot;: &quot;100%&quot;, &quot;host_has_profile_pic&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_id&quot;: 19259181, &quot;host_identity_verified&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_is_superhost&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;host_listings_count&quot;: 4.0, &quot;host_location&quot;: &quot;Austin, Texas, United States&quot;, &quot;host_name&quot;: &quot;Isaac&quot;, &quot;host_neighbourhood&quot;: &quot;East Downtown&quot;, &quot;host_picture_url&quot;: &quot;https://a1.muscache.com/ac/users/19259181/profile_pic/1419956774/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=225:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_response_rate&quot;: &quot;100%&quot;, &quot;host_response_time&quot;: &quot;within an hour&quot;, &quot;host_since&quot;: &quot;2014-07-31&quot;, &quot;host_thumbnail_url&quot;: &quot;https://a1.muscache.com/ac/users/19259181/profile_pic/1419956774/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none\\u0026crop=w:w;*,*\\u0026crop=h:h;*,*\\u0026resize=50:*\\u0026output-format=jpg\\u0026output-quality=70&quot;, &quot;host_total_listings_count&quot;: 4.0, &quot;host_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19259181&quot;, &quot;host_verifications&quot;: &quot;[\\u0027email\\u0027, \\u0027phone\\u0027, \\u0027google\\u0027, \\u0027linkedin\\u0027, \\u0027reviews\\u0027, \\u0027kba\\u0027]&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: 6006471, &quot;index_right&quot;: 0, &quot;instant_bookable&quot;: &quot;f&quot;, &quot;is_location_exact&quot;: &quot;t&quot;, &quot;jurisdiction_names&quot;: null, &quot;last_review&quot;: &quot;2015-10-28&quot;, &quot;last_scraped&quot;: &quot;2015-11-07&quot;, &quot;latitude&quot;: 30.254355472476217, &quot;license&quot;: null, &quot;listing_url&quot;: &quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6006471&quot;, &quot;longitude&quot;: -97.7473204134178, &quot;market&quot;: &quot;Austin&quot;, &quot;maximum_nights&quot;: 1125, &quot;medium_url&quot;: &quot;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/89587556/c00186ef_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium&quot;, &quot;minimum_nights&quot;: 2, &quot;monthly_price&quot;: &quot;$2,900.00&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Amazing Downtown S Congress Unit&quot;, &quot;neighborhood_overview&quot;: &quot;S Congress Ave has some of the best restaurants, cafes, food trucks, bars, and live music in the city!

As a registered travel agent, I am able to work while I enjoy tours and activities in places like London, Paris, Rome, New York, San Francisco, and Hawaii, to name a few.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have always wanted to own/operate a hotel.  That has been a passion of mine since I was a child.  For that reason, I enjoy having guests staying in my rental properties, and I want to provide so much more than just a place to stay.  My goal is to create a memorable experience for my guests.  I want my guests to know that not only does Austin deliver a good time, but that this home away from home is waiting for you.  With my connections in the travel industry, and tenure in the city, I strive to provide a level of service you will not find with other rental managers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease feel free to ask as many questions as you like.  I enjoy talking about Austin and the property, so I welcome you to communicate with me.

I love going to local restaurants, live music, reading books, and watching movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will be as helpful as I can to any guests.  This will include anything from instructions to use the TV or chromecast, to giving you advice on places to eat or check out while in town, or even give you a lift if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\&quot;Remembering that I\\u2019ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\\u2019ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything \\u2014 all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure \\u2014 these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.

I\\u0027ve lived and worked in this area for years, and I actually made a map of the area for my last job (listed in photos). It\\u0027s changing a lot, in good and bad ways.  The neighborhood is comprised mostly of working class Mexican families, students, and techies.  For travelers, this is what\\u0027s great:  1. It\\u0027s next door to an awesome river great for kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding, as well as a several mile hike and bike trail loop. 2. There is a ton of awesome Mexican food around the block! 3. Buzz Mill, Austin\\u0027s best 24hr coffee shop, is a five minute walk away.  4. There are a number of close and convenient transportation options.  5. Downtown is 15 minutes away by bus and 5 minutes by car.  The apartment is located in a neighborhood that is primarily low-income and the facade of the buildings is run down. It is a totally safe complex, but there are things in the neighborhood that you might see in other low-income neighborhoods.

    "Results are largely unsurprising, but nonetheless reassuring. Both an extra bedroom and an extra bathroom increase the final price around 30%. Accounting for those, an extra bed pushes the price about 2%. Neither the number of guests included nor the number of listings the host has in total have a significant effect on the final price.\n",

    "Including a spatial weights object in the regression buys you an extra bit: the summary provides results on the diagnostics for spatial dependence. These are a series of statistics that test whether the residuals of the regression are spatially correlated, against the null of a random distribution over space. If the latter is rejected a key assumption of OLS, independently distributed error terms, is violated. Depending on the structure of the spatial pattern, different strategies have been defined within the spatial econometrics literature to deal with them. The main summary from the diagnostics for spatial dependence is that there is clear evidence to reject the null of spatial randomness in the residuals, hence an explicitly spatial approach is warranted.\n",

    "## Spatially lagged exogenous regressors (`WX`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most straightforward way to introduce space is by **\"spatially lagging\" one of the explanatory variables**. Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ln(P_i) = \\alpha + \\beta X_i + \\delta \\sum_j w_{ij} X'_i + \\epsilon_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\ln(P_i)$ is our dependent variable (logarithmic price), $X'_i$ is a subset of $X_i$, although it could encompass all of the explanatory variables, and $w_{ij}$ is the $ij$-th cell of a spatial weights matrix $W$. Because $W$ assigns non-zero values only to spatial neighbors, if $W$ is row-standardized (customary in this context), then $\\sum_j w_{ij} X'_i$ captures the average value of $X'_i$ in the surroundings of location $i$. This is what we call the *spatial lag* of $X_i$. Also, since it is a spatial transformation of an explanatory variable, the standard estimation approach -OLS- is sufficient: spatially lagging the variables does not violate any of the assumptions on which OLS relies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we will want to spatially lag variables that we think may affect the price of a house in a given location. For example, one could think that pools represent a visual amenity. If that is the case, then listed properties surrounded by other properties with pools might, everything else equal, be more expensive. To calculate the number of pools surrounding each property, we can build an alternative weights matrix that we do not row-standardize:"

    "Results are largely consistent with the original model. Also, incidentally, the number of pools surrounding a property does not appear to have any significant effect on the price of a given property. This could be for a host of reasons: maybe AirBnb customers do not value the number of pools surrounding a property where they are looking to stay; but maybe they do but our dataset only allows us to capture the number of pools in *other* AirBnb properties, which is not necessarily a good proxy of the number of pools in the immediate surroundings of a given property.\n",

    "1. Unlike before, this specification *does* violate some of the assumptions on which OLS relies. In particular, it is including an endogenous variable $\\ln(P_i)$ on the right-hand side. This means we need a new estimation method to obtain reliable coefficients. The technical details of this go well beyond the scope of this tutorial. But we can offload those to `PySAL` and use the `GM_Lag` class, which implements the state-of-the-art approach to estimate this model.\n",
    "1. A more conceptual *gotcha*: you might be tempted to read the equation above as the effect of the price in neighboring locations $j$ on that of location $i$. This is not exactly the exact interpretation. Instead, we need to realize this is all assumed to be a \"joint decission\": rather than some houses setting their price first and that having a subsequent effect on others, what the equation models is an interdependent process by which each owner sets her own price *taking into account* the price that will be set in neighboring locations. This might read a bit like a technical subtlety and, to some extent, it is; but it is important to keep it in mind when you are interpreting the results.\n",
