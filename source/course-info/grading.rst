Grading
=======

Course grades will be given using the standard six-level grading scale from 0 to 5.
Course grade will be based on 1) the weekly exercises and 2) the final poster.

The final grade is based 40 % on the final poster assignment and 60 % on weekly exercise submissions.

.. note:: Please submit your exercise reports on time

          Generally, weekly exercises are due in one week's time (before the exercise session in the following week of exercise assignment).
          Please let the instructors know before the deadline if you anticipate you will not be able to submit on time.
