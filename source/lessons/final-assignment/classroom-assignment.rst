    Before starting the final assignment, **you need to communicate with your group members, who will create the team** and give it an appropriate name (e.g. "Group-1" if you were named as Group 1),
    so that **others can find and join the team**. After this process, your team will have a shared repository for the final assignment and you can all access it
    with your Github accounts.
