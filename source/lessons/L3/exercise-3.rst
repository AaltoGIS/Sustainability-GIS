**Due date:** Please complete this exercise by **the end of day on Wednesday the 3rd of February 2021** (day before the next practical session).

.. admonition:: Exercise 3 - Start your assignment

    You can start working on your personal (private) copy of Exercise by `accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment <>`__. Notice that if you are using
    GitHub Classroom for the first time, it might ask from you a permission to verify your GitHub identity. In such case, choose "Authorize GitHub Classroom".

    After you have your personal exercise in GitHub, start doing the programming using CSC Notebooks:
