Recommended readings
====================

Thinking of the breadth of the scope in this course (sustainability + SDS), there are countless of valuable articles, books and other resources that are "good reads".
Here, we list only a fraction of resources that we have found useful or which have been important in these fields in one way or another.
**Note:** These are not obligatory readings for the registered students, but good places to start if the topics interest you more broadly.
We will specify in the Exercises if there are any articles that you should read in addition to the lecture materials (unlikely during this year).
